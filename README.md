## Motivation

The idea of working on this project is to getting familiar with how sales data looks like and what key insights can be deduced from simple analysis.

The project is inspired from the YouTube tutorial by Keith Galli conducted using Python.

## Objectives

The data is for 12 months of sales for an electronic shop.

Analyze the monthly sales data for an year and identify:

1. The month with most sales
2. The best selling product - overall and monthly
3. Time (month of the year, day of the week, hour of the day) when sales peaked and the corresponding products
4. State that contributed to the maximum revenue
5. Contributions of the different cities
6. Number of unique invoices
7. Possible time frames for promotions

## Key learnings

After conducting the EDA, one gets familiar with the following topics:

1. Reading and concatenating csv files
2. Working with dates
3. Augmenting data
4. Text analysis
5. Filtering data
6. Visualizing data with ggplot2

## Data

The sales data is from this [Github repo](https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks).
